# Determine-if-String-Halves-Are-Alike
You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let a be the first half and b be the second half.  Two strings are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.
